I will join the <a href="https://cs.illinois.edu/" style="text-decoration:none">Department of Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC)</a>

My research interests broadly spans **natural language processing** and **machine learning**.
My current interests primarily include making language AI more efficient and accessible, and grounding in large-scale language models.
